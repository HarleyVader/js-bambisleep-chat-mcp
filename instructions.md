# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration Guide

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized way for AI applications to connect with external data sources and tools. This guide provides instructions for implementing an MCP client and/or server in our project.

## What is MCP?

MCP allows AI models like Claude to:
- Access data from your local files, databases, or content repositories
- Utilize tools like GitHub, Google Maps, or web browsers
- Perform tasks that would otherwise be outside the model's capabilities

Think of MCP as a universal adapter for AI applications, similar to what USB-C is for physical devices.

## Architecture

MCP follows a client-server architecture:
- **Hosts**: LLM applications (like Claude Desktop) that initiate connections
- **Clients**: Maintain 1:1 connections with servers, inside the host application
- **Servers**: Provide context, tools, and prompts to clients

## Key Components

### 1. Resources
- File-like data that can be read by clients
- Examples: API responses, file contents, database records
- Identified by unique URIs
- Can be discovered through resource listings or URI templates

### 2. Tools
- Functions that can be called by the LLM (with user approval)
- Enable AI models to perform calculations, access external APIs, etc.
- Defined with schemas that specify input parameters and expected outputs
- Can return text, images, audio, or resource references

### 3. Prompts
- Pre-written templates to help users accomplish specific tasks
- User-controlled and explicitly selected
- Can include dynamic arguments for customization
- Support multi-modal content (text, images, audio)

## Implementation Considerations

### For Client Implementation
1. **Transport Support**: Implement stdio (standard) and possibly HTTP with SSE
2. **Capability Negotiation**: Handle protocol version and feature negotiation
3. **Human in the Loop**: Always provide user interface to review and approve tool execution
4. **Security**: Validate all inputs, sanitize data, implement proper auth if needed

### For Server Implementation
1. **Feature Exposure**: Decide which capabilities to expose (resources, tools, prompts)
2. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error management
3. **Security**: Validate inputs, implement proper access controls, protect sensitive data
4. **Documentation**: Clearly document all tools, resources, and prompts

## Security Best Practices
1. **User Consent**: Always obtain explicit user consent for data access and operations
2. **Data Privacy**: Protect user data with appropriate access controls
3. **Tool Safety**: Treat tools as arbitrary code execution with appropriate caution
4. **Validation**: Validate all inputs thoroughly to prevent injection attacks

## Getting Started

### Setting Up a Client
1. Initialize the client with appropriate capabilities
2. Implement transport layer (stdio or HTTP+SSE)
3. Handle capability negotiation during initialization
4. Implement resource discovery and reading
5. Add tool discovery and execution with user approval

### Setting Up a Server
1. Define server capabilities (resources, tools, prompts)
2. Implement handlers for resource requests
3. Create tool definitions and implementations
4. Add prompt templates and handlers
5. Test with the MCP Inspector tool

## Testing
1. Use the MCP Inspector tool to test your server implementation
2. Verify all resources are properly exposed
3. Test tool execution with various inputs
4. Ensure prompt templates render correctly
